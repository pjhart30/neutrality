			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p id="background">
				Before the Internet, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was
				created through the Communications Act of 1934; a group that would play
				an instrumental role in regulating how the Internet is handled and what's
				considered fair play and what isn't. Along with it, telecommunication
				companies were given the <strong>common carrier</strong> label, granting
				the FCC increased control in regulating their practices, especially
				preventing telecommunications monopolies. In its early years, the Internet
				was seen mainly as a superior communication avenue to more traditional methods
				methods like writing letters, or even relatively advanced forms like the
				telegram or radio. Thus, it was viewed as a communication service by the FCC
				as part of Title 1. Laws protecting net-neutrality, a now infamous term first
				used by professor of law at UVA, Tim Wu, appeared to be on an upswing when the
				FCC re-labeled the Internet as a utility under Title 2, giving them
				increased policing power over ISPs. They also passed the Open Internet Order
				in 2010 which strengthened the FCC's grip over ISPs in favor of net-neutrality.
				This only lasted two years, however, before the FCC, backed by newly
				appointed chairman Ajit Pai, repealed net-neutrality back to the more
				loosely-regulated laws under Title 1. This included ISPs no longer being
				considered as common carriers, a big hit to the FCC's ability to enforce
				net-neutrality.

				One of the biggest components of net-neutrality is the banning of
				<strong>throttling</strong> by ISPs. Throttling is the act of bottle-
				necking (or flat-out blocking) service to certain customers or for certain
				requests. The picture of the funnel helps illustrate how bandwidth gets
				allocated before and after throttling. An example of throttling is when
				Comcast was found to be throttling BitTorrent traffic which led to an
				extensive battle in the courts with the FCC, one that Comcast ultimately won.
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent throttling, many ISPs use <strong>over-provisioning</strong>.
				Over-provisioning is where the ISP identifies the peaks and valleys in
				Internet traffic at various times during the day and allocates more or less
				bandwidth accordingly. So rather than having to throttle requests during
				the Super Bowl for example, the ISP will increase the bandwidth during
				the Super Bowl where millions of people will be taxing the bandwidth while
				decreasing it in the middle of the night where much fewer users need the
				bandwidth. This is a great and simple way in my opinion of avoiding net-
				neutrality issues related to throttling.
