		<h1>Net Neutrality Background and Position</h1>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p id="background">
				Before the Internet, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was
				created through the Communications Act of 1934; a group that would play
				an instrumental role in regulating how the Internet is handled and what's
				considered fair play and what isn't. Along with it, telecommunication
				companies were given the <strong>common carrier</strong> label, granting
				the FCC increased control in regulating their practices, especially
				preventing telecommunications monopolies. In its early years, the Internet
				was seen mainly as a superior communication avenue to more traditional methods
				methods like writing letters, or even relatively advanced forms like the
				telegram or radio. Thus, it was viewed as a communication service by the FCC
				as part of Title 1. Laws protecting net-neutrality, a now infamous term first
				used by professor of law at UVA, Tim Wu, appeared to be on an upswing when the
				FCC re-labeled the Internet as a utility under Title 2, giving them
				increased policing power over ISPs. They also passed the Open Internet Order
				in 2010 which strengthened the FCC's grip over ISPs in favor of net-neutrality.
				This only lasted two years, however, before the FCC, backed by newly
				appointed chairman Ajit Pai, repealed net-neutrality back to the more
				loosely-regulated laws under Title 1. This included ISPs no longer being
				considered as common carriers, a big hit to the FCC's ability to enforce
				net-neutrality.

			<h3>Net-Neutrality</h3>

			<p>
				I think the video above is a great explanation of net-neutrality in layman's
				terms with an easy-to-follow analogy. I recommend watching that before
				continuing reading if you are unsure of what exactly net-neutrality means.
				One of the biggest components of net-neutrality is disallowing <strong>
				throttling</strong> by ISPs. Throttling is the act of bottle-necking (or
				flat-out blocking) service to certain customers or for certain requests.
				The picture of the funnel below helps illustrate how bandwidth gets
				allocated before and after throttling. An example of throttling is when
				Comcast was found to be throttling BitTorrent traffic which led to an
				extensive battle in the courts with the FCC, one that Comcast ultimately won.
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent throttling, many ISPs use <strong>over-provisioning</strong>.
				Over-provisioning is where the ISP identifies the peaks and valleys in
				Internet traffic at various times during the day and allocates more or less
				bandwidth accordingly. So rather than having to throttle requests during
				the Super Bowl for example, the ISP will increase the bandwidth during
				the Super Bowl where millions of people will be taxing the bandwidth while
				decreasing it in the middle of the night where much fewer users need the
				bandwidth. This is a great and simple way in my opinion of avoiding net-
				neutrality issues related to throttling.

			<h3>Political/Philosophical Views</h3>
			<p>
				I'm going to compare two political/philosophical views on net-neutrality:
				laissez-faire capitalism and socialism. A laissez-faire point of view on
				net-neutrality would certainly be against intervention by the government
				in the business practices of ISPs, meaning the ISPs are free to operate
				however they please regarding the allocation of bandwidth and rate limiting
				wherever they see fit. The price customers have to pay to use the ISP services
				is also determined entirely by the free market which in theory would
				encourage healthy competition between ISPs. Due to the overwhelming barriers
				to entry in the ISP market with companies needing the wherewithal to support
				the massive network infrastructure necessary to provide Internet services,
				these markets often break down into natural oligopolies with a small number
				of firms controlling nearly the entire market.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the opposite side, a socialist point of view would encourage heavy
				government involvement in stopping the ISP market from setting out-of-control
				prices for Internet use, throttling requests they don't find favorable, and
				rate-limiting customers who don't pay enough money. Stricter regulation is
				needed to limit monopolies and the abuse of that position of power by ISPs,
				which of course ultimately has severe negative ramifications for consumers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I tend to side with the socialist point of view regarding net-neutrality.
				Being a consumer that relies heavily on the services provided to me by ISPs,
				Also, from a fairness perspective, the Internet should be an open network of
				information where people can access all publicly-available sites <strong>
				equally</strong> and without ISPs essentially extorting consumers into paying
				an arm and a leg for their service when they really don't have any other way
				to access the Internet.
